Rocco is a 73 year old Italian man, who is not completely senile, but may have some minor amnesia. He is well known for his distrust of banks, leading him to resort purely to cash transactions.

## Details  
- Good friends with fellow old man Gerald
- Rocco does amateur food reviews from local businesses
- He has been a panel beater for all 73 years of his life
- Rocco's memory resembles that of a gold fish
