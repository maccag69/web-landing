An out-of-character wiki of characters, organisations and the FDG world in general. A place to learn more about those you interact with on FDG.

## Purpose of Lore in FDG

![lore club scene](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/184556449383448576/1142445949969506446/20200807204153_1.jpg?width=1658&height=905)

Lore inevitably writes itself. As a roleplay server, FDG encourages players to create wholesome characters with rich backstories and genuine depth. It's this pursuit for real creativity and expression that inevitably create lore for not only characters, but the businesses and organisation throughout FDG.

The lore section within FDG's out-of-character wiki offers a comprehensive resource for users to learn about characters, organizations, and the overall fictional world. This section provides background information that enriches interactions in the FDG universe, allowing users to make informed decisions and engage more deeply with the setting. It serves as a separate repository of information, enhancing the immersive experience of role-playing and storytelling within the FDG world.
